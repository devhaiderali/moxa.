# moxa. — Personal Portfolio Landing Page

Hey there! 👋 I’m Tayler, a creative designer turned front‑end tinkerer. This is my minimal, playful landing page built with HTML & CSS.




## 🎯 What Is This?

This repo contains the code for my personal “moxa.” portfolio homepage. It’s a single‑page layout that introduces me, showcases my skill set, and invites folks to get in touch.

- **Clean typography** with a bold, modern feel  
- **Subtle accents** (that little orange “sun” icon 🌞) for personality    



## 🔨 Tech Stack

- **HTML5** for structure  
- **CSS3** (Flexbox + Grid) for layout  
- No libraries/frameworks—just good old vanilla code!
